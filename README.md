# Market-Segment-Prediction-Using-Clustering-and-Classification-


<!-- My group and I from SMU Data Mining course has done a project on Predicting market segments of E-Commerce consumers based on their profitability using Clustering and Classification Methods -->

<!-- Credits goes to my group - Amir, Daniel, Jaye, Helisa, Subhashini, Jasmine -->


<!-- As a brief introduction, in our current landscape, the digital economy is becoming more and more profitable, especially after the pandemic which has boosted the number of people as well as the amount spent on online platforms. In fact, the South East Asian digital economy is projected to reach 1t gross merchandise value by 2030

This has created new challenges where there is now a larger, less homogenous consumer base which means that new channels have to be created in order to attract these customers and meet their growing expectations

This bring our motivation behind this project which is that effective customer segmentation and value prediction is a key competitive advantage for businesses
